Musicians exhibit distinct EEG brain activity compared to non-musicians, a difference attributed to the enhanced cognitive abilities developed through musical training. While many EEG studies focus on identifying the current state of participants, such as their emotions, few studies investigate past background information about participants based on their EEG patterns. This study investigates whether EEG data can reveal the extent of musical training, specifically the number of years a listener has spent playing musical instruments. We hypothesize that integrating spatial features, local temporal features, and global temporal features from raw EEG signals will provide a more accurate estimate of the years of musical training than using only spatial and local temporal features. To test this, we constructed a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture spatial and local features from the Open MIIR dataset, followed by a multihead transformer to capture global temporal features. These abstracted features were then fed into a fully connected neural network to predict the years of musical training. We implemented a 50% dropout in the CNN and calculated the loss using cross-entropy. Our findings indicate that the hybrid model of CNN and Transformer effectively predicts the number of years of musical training a participant has. This suggests that hidden patterns in EEG signals, elicited while listening to music, are informative of musical training experiences. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether the addition of the transformer improves prediction accuracy over using only spatial and local temporal features. Our study had limitations, including the absence of a validation dataset and unsmoothed data, which may have introduced noise. Additionally, the classification of participants into categorical labels (e.g., 0 years, 5-7 years, 10 years) results in a loss of precise numerical information regarding the years of training. Future research should address these limitations and further validate the plausibility and accuracy of our approach.
